Materials in this folder relate to the NLP parsing.

The HTML_Extraction Folder contains a Python program that extracts the specifications from the ECMA-262 specification HTML file. It uses the HTML tags and formatting to identify the different elements of the HTML document and outputs the specifications in a format that matches the relevant section document generated by Swami. The idea is that the code in this program will essentially replace the ExtractRelevantSections component of Swami in the final project.

The POS_Tagging folder contains a program that runs part-of-speech tagging on the lines in the specification. The tagging itself will eventually be incorporated into the final project, but there is some additional functionality that is more for informational purposes. For example, the program generated the UniquePatternsAndExamples file that lists all discovered POS patterns along with all lines that match each particular pattern.
