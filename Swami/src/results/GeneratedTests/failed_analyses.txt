-Failed Tests seem to happen when randominput is a string
This was one of the three functions that gave bad tests for Swami as well.
The other two functions didn't have bad tests for us, because we encoded additional lines from the specifications that prevented the bad behavior
Here, the bad test is called in "If Type(O) is not Object, throw a TypeError exception."
	I think it's the same overloading problem where the wrong slice() function is called
	the specification here does not have a check to prevent this

---../results/Node_ECMA262_Tests/test-array(items).js       			1000

in specificaiton function is actually given as "Array ( ...items )"
	items is actually supposed to be multiple arguments, but it was encoded as one in our template generation
	failure happens at first assert check, where numberOfArgs >= 2
		this is also the only thing being tested
	this might be fixable - make tests have multiple arguments

---../results/Node_ECMA262_Tests/test-array.js       				1000

Only test is an assert that number of arguments === 0
	all test calls have exactly one argument, meaning we will always get bad test
	running test with no input gives good test, but you can't do 1000 test cases of this
	seems like this test isn't contributing anything, should it be removed?
		should tests for functions with no input be removed?

---../results/Node_ECMA262_Tests/test-createarrayiterator.js       		831

only test is assert typeof ( array ) ===  "object"
	Good test when array is a regular expression
	Bad test in every other case
This is an abstract operation, should have been filtered out anyway

Also an abstract operation
