Generating Test Oracles Automatically

At the moment, materials are split into two folders. The Swami folder contains a copy of the Swami tool, including the source code. The intention is to use this code as a foundation for our project, where we use and NLP approach to generate test templates as opposed to regular expressions.

The ParsingMaterials folder contains our own project materials that relate to the NLP parsing. These materials will ultimately be used in our project.
